## Description ##

![demo-coffee-cup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4063887/52908204-afc42180-3236-11e9-9dc7-cd52718000f9.gif)

This is a [Google Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr/index.html) with a block editor back-end (the cup shown above is by [Poly by Google](https://poly.google.com/user/4aEd8rQgKu2)).

It's experimental, and requires an Android device [that can run ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices), and earlier versions of Chrome Dev or Canary (70-72). Using older browsers like these is only advisable on a testing device, not your normal phone.

Please see the [Getting Set Up](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr/index.html#1) section of the Codelab. The files from the Google Codelab are mainly copied from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/ar-with-webxr/tree/7f8b796b546996d522ecd4e22c41d54f58b40778), with slight changes.

**Setup**
1. Find `.obj` and `.mtl` files for a 3D object, like from [Poly](https://poly.google.com/) or [Free3D](https://free3d.com/3d-models/obj-file)
2. In the block (Gutenberg) editor, add an "AR Viewer" block
3. Select the `.obj` and `.mtl` files in the block UI, and click "Save Draft" or "Update":

4. View the front-end of the post
5. Click "Start SSR Demo"
6. Rotate the screen until an anchor appears:

7. Click the anchor, and see the 3d object. The object below is from [Poly](https://poly.google.com/view/1HpVP5w2x1D), created by [Poly by Google](https://poly.google.com/user/4aEd8rQgKu2):
